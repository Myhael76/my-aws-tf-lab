# My AWS Terraform Lab

This repository groups a bunch of personal trials regarding IaC with Terraform for AWS.

While looking at some base concepts I discovered [CloudPosse's modules collection](https://github.com/cloudposse?q=terraform-), which seems to be a real accelerator in this case.

## Spikes

My trials are found in the subfolder [spikes](./spikes) and are numbered progressively as I go on.
